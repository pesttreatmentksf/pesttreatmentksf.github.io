Greenhouses supply a suitable environment (e.g., temperature and light) for numerous biological control representatives or natural enemies including parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
<p>They believed that some qualities of area-wide management are incompatible with many conventional IRM methods, but recommended that use of biologically based control strategies, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, might contribute to both area-wide pest management and IRM. After carrying out any pest management method, inspect the sign plants to assess if arthropod pests have been killed and evaluate the efficiency and durability of control.</p>
