<p>Monitoring and identification minimizes the risks of using the wrong type of pesticide, or using pesticides when other techniques will be more effective. The advantage of the fogging pest control technique is that it's considered to be environmentally friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are difficult to be cleaned. Cultural practices - rely on a technique to make the crop or environment unacceptable to pests by interfering with their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or location by both immatures and adults.</p>
<p>When pest issues are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry toxins in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
