<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and discourage pest perseverance include intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>Other than this, most of the pest control companies have some repair charges for few specific areas. Non-synthetic or natural pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall into this IPM group. Risk for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (useful or harmless) types that habituate in the fields or orchards.
