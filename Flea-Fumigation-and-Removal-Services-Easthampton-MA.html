These may or may not consist of products noted on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and especially insecticides utilized in organic farming and natural gardening are normally safer than artificial pesticides, they are not constantly more ecologically friendly or safe than synthetic pesticides and can cause damage.</p>
<p>Under this scheme, pest control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from periodic tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can deal with a big range of pests found in Texas, consisting of spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders.
