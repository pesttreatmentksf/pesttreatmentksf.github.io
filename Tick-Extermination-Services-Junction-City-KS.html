<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like ants, spiders, or roaches, we will determine the source of the problem. The objective is to provide an overall understanding of the principles of IPM, together with the concepts for application in all crops.

Rentokil PCI has actually developed its knowledge and know-how over 90 years and in over 60 nations worldwide to use reliable pest management solutions through an international team of expertly trained service technicians.

For instance, a rich neighborhood likely will have a lot of big, costly houses, so pest control expenses might be greater there because there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those houses.</p>
