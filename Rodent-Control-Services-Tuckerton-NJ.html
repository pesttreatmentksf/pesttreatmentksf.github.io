<p>Under this scheme, bug control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can deal with a big range of pests found in Texas, including spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders. Sprays, are best utilized versus flying pests and biting pests, such as fleas A lot of insects will pass away within minutes of entering contact with an insecticide spray, however some persistent bugs may make you spray the area several times prior to quiting.</p>

Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about minimizing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management tactics are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
<p>Recognition of the pest, understanding its biology and seasonal population patterns, destructive life stages and their habitats, nature of the damage and its economic significance, the vulnerability of each life phase for several control options, host preference and alternate hosts, predictability of pest incident based on the environment, cropping patterns, farming practices, and other influencing aspects, and all the associated details is vital for determining a reliable control technique.</p>
